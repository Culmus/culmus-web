<H1>OpenType support for Hebrew fonts</H1>
<P>This page presents some FontForge scripts which I find useful in
creating OpenType fonts. An example can be found at the end of the
page.</P>

<H2>Glyph substitution</H2>
<P>Hebrew typefaces may include several features for glyph
substitution. These features can be created semi-automatically using
the provided script <code>AddHebrewGSUB.py</code>. The features include</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B><I>Dagesh</I> ligatures.</B> All consonant glyphs except
	the final forms, followed by <I>dagesh</I> glyph, can be replaced
	with an appropriate composite glyph.<BR><IMG SRC="beth-dagesh.png" NAME="Beth dagesh" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=254 HEIGHT=34 BORDER=0></P>
	<LI><P><B><I>Shin</I> ligatures.</B> <I>Shin</I> glyph without <I>sin</I>
	or <I>shin dot</I> can be followed by a separate <I>sin/shin dot</I>
	glyph and possibly by <I>dagesh</I>. It will also be replaced by an
	appropriate ligature.<BR><IMG SRC="shin-dot.png" NAME="Shin dot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=0></P>
	<LI><P><B>Yiddish ligatures.</B> Unicode specification includes
	several letters which are present only in the Yiddish alphabet, such
	as <I>pasekh tsvey yudn</I>, and these can replace the sequence of
	solitary glyphs when appropriate. The script sets these ligatures to
	be active only when the text is marked as an Yiddish language text
	in a text editor (OpenType language tag “hebr{JII }”). This
	feature is primarily of academic interest, as virtually no text
	editors support OpenType with respect to language specification.<BR><IMG SRC="beth-rafe.png" NAME="Beth rafe" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=254 HEIGHT=37 BORDER=0></P>
	<LI><P><B>Justification alternatives.</B> One can see in Torah
	scrolls and printed editions, or in older newspapers, that line
	justification is often achieved by replacing certain letters by
	their wide counterparts. The script defines “jalt” substitution
	feature to allow that. It seems that no software supports this
	feature except Adobe InDesign.<BR><IMG SRC="wide-dalet.png" NAME="Justification alternative" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=34 BORDER=0></P>
	<LI><P><B>Miscellaneous ligatures and substitutions.</B></P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P><I>Final kaf</I> with <I>shwa</I> / <I>qamats</I>. The <I>final
		kaf</I> is the only final form which may bear diacritics. The
		diacritics are usually placed above the normal diacritics line,
		almost in the middle of the glyph. In order to simplify the display
		of these cases, some fonts may contain precomposed glyphs which
		already include the <I>final kaf</I> with <I>shwa</I> and <I>qamats</I>.
		In that case it is necessary to define these glyphs as ligatures.<BR><IMG SRC="final-kaf-qamatz.png" NAME="Final kaf-kamatz ligature" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=249 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0></P>
		<LI><P><I>Holam male</I>. In a similar manner, <I>vav</I> with
		<I>holam</I> also comes precomposed in some fonts, and then it
		should be defined as a ligature.<BR><IMG SRC="vav-holam.png" NAME="Vav-holam ligature" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=0></P>
		<LI><P><I>Aleph-lamed</I>. In prayer books printed in Ladino with
		Hebrew alphabet, <I>aleph</I> and <I>lamed</I> are replaced by a
		special ligature. The script defines this ligature twice. Once it
		is defined as a mandatory ligature for Ladino texts, in the similar
		form as Yiddish ligatures are mandatory in Yiddish texts. The other
		time it is defined as a discretionary ligature (“dlig”), so the
		designer can choose to use it in Hebrew text at her discretion, to
		achieve some sort of medieval spirit.<BR><IMG SRC="aleph-lamed.png" NAME="Aleph-lamed ligature" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=44 BORDER=0></P>
		<LI><P>Alternative plus. In books intended for religious audience
		the plus sign is sometimes replaced with its alternative form,
		which lacks the bottom stroke. The script defines this replacement
		as a stylistic alternative (“salt”), to be used at the
		designer's discretion. <BR><IMG SRC="plus.png" NAME="Alternative plus" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0></P>
		<LI><P><I>Ayin</I> without descender. In pointed texts a
		diacritical mark under the letter <I>ayin</I> may interfere with
		the descender, creating an esthetically unpleasant disturbance in
		the normal text flow. For this purpose a contextual substitution
		feature is introduced, which replaces regular <I>ayin</I> with <I>ayin</I>
		without descender whenever it is followed by a lower point. Unlike
		all other features, this is not automatic. As of December 2006,
		Fontforge scripting doesn't support contextual substitutions, so
		the script only defines an auxiliary “AAYN” feature tag, and
		the user must perform some manual steps laid out inside the script
		to complete the substitution feature. Besides that, the <I>ayin</I>
		without descender is defined as a stylistic alternative (“salt”)
		to <I>ayin</I>, for general usage.<BR><IMG SRC="ayin-qamats.png" NAME="Alternative ayin" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=45 BORDER=0></P>

<H2>Diacritics positioning</H2>
<P>The method I use for diacritics is somewhat idiosyncratic, but I
find it convenient. I use FontForge metrics view (Window-&gt;New
Metrics Window) to define a diacritical mark position in the form of
a kerning pair between the basic glyph (consonant) and the mark
(vowel). This view provides an immediate visual feedback, which
greatly simplifies the task of the fine tuning. Then I run script
<code>Kern2Comments.py</code> which converts the kerning pair to a special form of
comment stored in the appropriate basic glyph. Another script
AddHebrewGPOS.pe converts these comments into final OpenType
information.</P>
<P>The most interesting script in this process is <code>AddHebrewGPOS.py</code>,
as it creates the actual OpenType anchors which set the positioning
of <I>nikkud</I>. The positioning values for the script are stored in
a special format inside glyph comments. For example, the glyph <I>lamed</I>
may contain the following comment:</P>
<blockquote><PRE>%DiaToBase1=200
%DiaToBase2=220
%DiaToBaseU=220
%DiaToBaseO=-70</PRE></blockquote>
<p>This comment can be translated as follows:</P>
<blockquote>The anchor DiaToBase1 for
narrow diacritics (<I>hiriq</I>, <I>shwa</I>) shall be located at
(200,0)<BR>The anchor DiaToBase2 for medium-width diacritics (<I>tsere</I>,
<I>patah</I>, <I>qamats</I>, <I>segol</I>) shall be located at
(220,0)<BR>The anchor DiaToBaseU for <I>qubutz</I> shall be located
at (220, 0)<BR>The anchor DiaToBaseO for <I>holam haser</I> shall be
located at (-70,0)</blockquote>
<P>First the script creates five anchor classes named
DiaToBase[123UO]. In this list 1 stands for narrow marks, 2 stands
for medium-width marks, 3 stands for <I>hataf</I> marks, U stands for
<I>qubutz</I>, and O stands for <I>holam haser</I>. Then it traverses
all vowels and sets on each vowel an anchor of the appropriate class.
The vowel anchors are always set at (0,0).</P>
<P>Furthermore, the script automatically traverses all consonants and
parses their respective comments to create anchors as appropriate.
The anchors set on consonants correspond to the anchors set on
vowels, to produce OpenType marks positioning. Generally, each
consonant bears an anchor for each class, thus having up to 5
anchors. In practice, some anchors may be absent, e.g. only glottal
consonants have anchor DiaToBase3 defined.</P>
<P>The script supports the notion of glyph equivalence, e.g. comments
stored for <I>lamed</I> are applied on <I>lamed dagesh</I> too, since
these two glyphs should have similar diacritics positioning.</P>
<P>An auxiliary script <code>InitHebrewGlyphData.py</code> defines static arrays
of vowels and consonants for use in <code>AddHebrewGPOS.py</code>. It maintains
consonant equivalence tables, describing glyphs which should be
considered equivalent for the purpose of diacritics positioning. It
also maintains vowel tables which describe anchor classes and marks
corresponding to these classes.</P>
<P>Another two auxiliary scripts <code>DumpComments.pe</code> and <code>LoadComments.pe</code>
dump glyph comments to external file comments_dump.txt, and load them
accordingly.</P>
